# MEO Node

This is the MEO Node project. In this project, we created a collection of nodes that can interact with device that are connected to MEO platform (NodeRED) with MEO-FDK. 

Moreover, we also created node able to interact with MEO Link IoT to control smart production devices base on Rogo IoT Platform.

## Version Table

**1.0.0 - Initial version**

In this version, we introduced meo-in and meo-out nodes that can interact with devices that use MEO FDK and/or able to send MQTT message.

This version use for interacting with DIY devices like ThingBot or ESP32, enabling students or starter to create their own IoT project.

**1.1.0 - MEO Link IoT**

MEO Link IoT & meo-link node are features that create interaction with smart production devices in NodeRED.

These two important features that help DIY devices can interact with smart production devices that use Rogo IoT Platform, allow more advanced IoT project with more complex devices.
